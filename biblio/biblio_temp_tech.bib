	abstract = {How does a literary historian end up thinking in terms of z-scores, principal component analysis, and clustering coefficients' The essays in Distant Reading led to a new and often contested paradigm of literary analysis. In presenting them here Franco Moretti reconstructs his intellectual trajectory, the theoretical influences over his work, and explores the polemics that have often developed around his positions. From the evolutionary model of "Modern European Literature," through the geo-cultural insights of "Conjectures of World Literature" and "Planet Hollywood," to the quantitative findings of "Style, inc." and the abstract patterns of "Network Theory, Plot Analysis," the book follows two decades of conceptual development, organizing them around the metaphor of "distant reading," that has come to define'well beyond the wildest expectations of its author'a growing field of unorthodox literary studies},

	title = {The Evolution of the Idiolect over the Lifetime: A Quantitative and Qualitative Study on French 19th Century Literature},
	abstract = {The way in which authors express themselves is unique but changes over their lifetime.
However, quantitative studies of this idiolectal evolution are rare. Using the Corpus for
Idiolectal Research ({CIDRE}) that contains the dated works of 11 prolific 19th century French
fiction writers, we propose new methods to identify, quantify and describe the grammatical-
stylistic changes that take place using lexico-morphosyntactic patterns, also called motifs. To
examine the strength of the chronological signal of change, we developed a method to
calculate if a distance matrix of literary works contains a stronger chronological signal than
expected by chance. Ten out of 11 corpora showed a higher than chance chronological
signal, leading us to conclude that the evolution of the idiolect is in a mathematical sense
monotonic, supporting the rectilinearity hypothesis previously put forward in the stylometric
literature. The rectilinear property of the evolution of the idiolect found for most authors in
{CIDRE} subsequently enabled us to propose a machine learning task: predicting the year in
which a work was written. For the majority of the authors in our corpus, the accuracy and the
amount of variance that is explained by the model were high and we discuss why the
technique might fail for others. After applying a feature selection algorithm, we examined the
most important features, i.e. the motifs that have the greatest influence on idiolectal
evolution. We find that some of those features are stylistic and have been previously
identified in qualitative literature studies. We report some remarkable stylistic constructions
revealed by our algorithm to illustrate which kind of stylistic patterns can be extracted using
our method},

Our study reports for the ﬁrst time that statistical stylometry can be surprisingly effective in discriminating highly successful literature from less successful counterpart, achieving accuracy up to 84\%. Closer analyses lead to several new insights into characteristics of the writing style in successful literature, including ﬁndings that are contrary to the conventional wisdom with respect to good writing style and readability.},

To test several idiolect and sociolect hypotheses a factorial combination was used of time period (Modernism, Realism), gender of author (male, female) and author (Eliot, Dickens, Woolf, Joyce) totaling 16 corresponding literary texts. In a series of corpus linguistic studies using Boolean and vector models, no conclusive evidence was found for the selected idiolect and sociolect hypotheses.

	abstract = {This thesis combines methods from sociology of literature and natural language processing to answer the questions: what is the relationship between author gender and the perceived literary quality of her work? And to what extent can textual qualities be ascribed to author gender? I first assess Dutch female authors' chances of gaining literary prestige. Even though female authors publish many literary works, they still have a harder time climbing the literary ladder. Results of the 2013 National Reader Survey mirror this skewness. Respondents were asked to supply ratings of literary quality, on a list of 401 recent, bestselling Dutch-language novels in several genres (the Riddle of Literary Quality corpus). Even within genre works by female authors' are judged to be of lesser quality, and 'feminine' novels are seen as the worst; formulaic detectives score better. Female author gender is not a conscious motivation, but analysis of respondents' motivations shows that instead, the text is associated with 'femaleness' - through genre, topics or style. Such associations lead to perception of lower literary quality. I then analyze the text of the novels themselves to examine to which extent such femaleness of text exists. First, computational analysis of the Riddle corpus indicates that author gender is too easily assumed to be the cause of text differences. Moreover, additional visualizations show that gender group differences are often caused by outliers. In the final chapters, I focus on a 'feminine' topic, attention to characters' physical appearance. I show that it is not exclusive to the genre of chick-lit, nor to female authors. In fact, male literary authors write most about physical appearance, in describing female love interests. This novel approach shows that female author gender is connected to the text differently than expected. By reading differently, literary quality can be judged separate from female author gender.},

	title = {Rich statistical parsing and literary language},
	abstract = {"This thesis studies parsing and literature with the Data-Oriented Parsing framework, which assumes that chunks of previous experience can be exploited to analyze new sentences. As chunks we consider syntactic tree fragments. After presenting a method to efficiently extract such fragments from treebanks based on heuristics of re-occurrence, we employ them to develop a multi-lingual statistical parser. We show how a mildly context-sensitive grammar can be employed to produce discontinuous constituents, and compare this to an approximation that stays within the efficiently parsable context-free framework. We show that tree fragments allow the grammar to adequately capture the statistical regularities of non-local relations, without the need for the increased generative capacity of mildly context-sensitive grammar. The second part investigates what separates literary from other novels. We work with a corpus of novels and a reader survey with ratings of how literary they are perceived to be. The main goal is to find out the extent to which the literary ratings can be predicted from the texts. We first evaluate simple measures such as vocabulary richness, text compressibility, and the number of clich?? expressions. In addition we apply more sophisticated, predictive models: a topic model, bag-of-words model, and a model based on syntactic tree fragments. We find that literary ratings are predictable from textual features to a large extent. While it is not possible to infer a causal relation, this result clearly rules out the notion that these value-judgments of literary merit were arbitrary, or predominantly determined by factors beyond the text."--Samenvatting auteur.},

Here, I introduce the harmonic mean

              -value ({HMP}), which controls the {FWER} while greatly improving statistical power by combining dependent tests using generalized central limit theorem. I show that the {HMP} effortlessly combines information to detect statistically significant signals among groups of individually nonsignificant hypotheses in examples of a human {GWAS} for neuroticism and a joint human–pathogen {GWAS} for hepatitis C viral load. The {HMP} simultaneously tests all ways to group hypotheses, allowing the smallest groups of hypotheses that retain significance to be sought. The power of the {HMP} to detect significant hypothesis groups is greater than the power of the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure to detect significant hypotheses, although the latter only controls the weaker false discovery rate ({FDR}). The {HMP} has broad implications for the analysis of large datasets, because it enhances the potential for scientific discovery.},

              This chapter presents the findings of an ongoing digital project of the Helsinki Computational History Group at Helsinki Centre for Digital Humanities ({HELDIG}) focused on the history of eighteenth-century book publication. The authors have created a historical-biographical database based on
              The English Short-Title Catalogue
              ({ESTC}), a standard source for analytical bibliographic research, and extracted a data-driven canon which considers changes over time, subject-topics, top-works, authors, publishers, publication place, and materiality. This chapter provides both methodological and historical insights into the development of print and demonstrates the huge analytical potential of harmonized metadata catalogs. While quantitative analyses of the book trade were attempted before, they did not engage with the complex process of canon formation at such a large scale. The authors’ work highlights the formative role played by publishers in this process and the epistemological shift started at the end of the seventeenth century, when religious works were increasingly replaced by literary works. As the authors argue, this shift in the production and consumption of print allowed for a reinvention of the canon during the eighteenth century.},

            The versified play Henry {VIII} is nowadays widely recognized to be a collaborative work not written solely by William Shakespeare. We employ combined analysis of vocabulary and versification together with machine learning techniques to determine which other authors took part in the writing of the play and what were their relative contributions. Unlike most previous studies, we go beyond the attribution of particular scenes and use the rolling attribution approach to determine the probabilities of authorship of pieces of texts, without respecting the scene boundaries. Our results highly support the canonical division of the play between William Shakespeare and John Fletcher proposed by James Spedding, but also bring new evidence supporting the modifications proposed later by Thomas Merriam.},

Moving beyond the limitations of literary interpretation based on the “close-reading” of individual works, the book describes how this new method of studying large collections of digital material can help us to better understand and contextualize the individual works within those collections.},

Forster I "His studies are not very deep," one character says about another in George Eliot's Middlemarch, "he is only reading a novel." Just imagine if that same critical judgement about novels and novel readers were accurate today! Not only would it be assumed that we all read novels merely to pass the time, but also with the assumption that they don't have much to teach us in the first place. We'd only be reading a novel, and that's it. The real knowledge about life and living, we'd be told, lies elsewhere, maybe in the great epics of bygone ages, intensely private lyric poems, or sweeping dramas where all the world's a stage. The novel, of course, still has its detractors, but no one can deny that this literary genre runs "very deep." Part of that depth comes from the fact that the novel, a term ironically rooted in the Latin word for new (novum), is actually rather old. In fact, by some accounts it goes back 4,000 years to the narrative fictions of ancient Egypt with examples appearing subsequently as far afield as Hellenistic Greece, the histories and romances of medieval China and France, and the subgenres of modern England, Russia, Brazil, Nigeria, Japan, and the United States. And if the forms of the novel are indeed many, they are evidence enough that there has been an ongoing desire across cultures and over millenia to tell fictional stories in prose about life" ...},

But it may be time to reexamine the assumption that numbers are useful only for objective description. Machine learning algorithms are actually bad at being objective and rather good at absorbing human perspectives implicit in the evidence used to train them. To dramatize perspectival uses of machine learning, I train models of genre on groups of books categorized by historical actors who range from Edwardian advertisers to contemporary librarians. Comparing the perspectives implicit in their choices casts new light on received histories of genre. Scientific romance and science fiction—whose shifting names have often suggested a fractured history—turn out to be more stable across two centuries than the genre we call fantasy. ({TU})},

Scientists and social scientists use them to think about the social or natural worlds and to represent those worlds in a simplified manner. Statistical models, which dominate the social sciences, particularly in economics, are typically equations with response and predictor variables. Specifically, a researcher seeks to understand some social phenomenon, such as the relation between students' scores on a math test and how many hours the students spent preparing for the exam. To predict or describe this relation, the researcher constructs a quantitative model with quantitative inputs (the number of hours each student spent studying) and outputs (each student's test score). The researcher hopes that the number of hours a student spent preparing for the exam will correlate with the student's score. If it does, this quantified relation can help describe the overall dynamics of test taking.},

	abstract = {Quantitative linguistics contradicts the much publicized theory naming Corneille as the author of Molière’s masterpieces.
          , 
            As for Shakespeare, a hard-fought debate has emerged about Molière, a supposedly uneducated actor who, according to some, could not have written the masterpieces attributed to him. In the past decades, the century-old thesis according to which Pierre Corneille would be their actual author has become popular, mostly because of new works in computational linguistics. These results are reassessed here through state-of-the-art attribution methods. We study a corpus of comedies in verse by major authors of Molière and Corneille’s time. Analysis of lexicon, rhymes, word forms, affixes, morphosyntactic sequences, and function words do not give any clue that another author among the major playwrights of the time would have written the plays signed under the name Molière.},
